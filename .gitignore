# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   usually managed by the user. However, for an application, it's sometimes useful to include.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them. In that case, the lock file should be added to .gitignore.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/pdm-project/pdm
