        """Build the prompt for analyzing the HAR file."""
        base_prompt = f"""You are tasked with analyzing a HAR (HTTP Archive) file to reverse engineer API calls,
         and generate production-ready Python code that replicates those calls.

Here is the HAR file path you need to analyze:
<har_path>
{self.har_path}
</har_path>

Here is the original user prompt with context about what they're trying to accomplish:
<user_prompt>
{self.prompt}
</user_prompt>

Here is the output directory where you should save your generated files:
<output_dir>
{self.scripts_dir}
</output_dir>

Your task is to:

1. **Read and analyze the HAR file** to understand all API calls that were captured. Look for:
   - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
   - Request URLs and endpoints
   - Request headers (especially authentication-related ones)
   - Request bodies and parameters
   - Response structures
   - Response status codes

2. **Identify authentication patterns** such as:
   - Cookies and session tokens
   - Authorization headers (Bearer tokens, API keys, etc.)
   - CSRF tokens or other security mechanisms
   - Custom authentication headers

3. **Extract request/response patterns** for each distinct endpoint:
   - Required vs optional parameters
   - Data formats (JSON, form data, etc.)
   - Query parameters vs body parameters
   - Response data structures

4. **Generate a Python script** that replicates these API calls with the following requirements:
   - Use the `requests` library as the default choice
   - Include proper authentication handling (sessions, headers, tokens)
   - Create separate functions for each distinct API endpoint
   - Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
   - Write comprehensive docstrings for each function
   - Implement proper error handling with try-except blocks
   - Add logging for debugging purposes
   - Make the code production-ready and maintainable
   - Include a main section with example usage

5. **Create documentation**:
   - Generate a README.md file that explains:
     - What APIs were discovered
     - How authentication works
     - How to use each function
     - Example usage
     - Any limitations or requirements

6. **Test your implementation**:
   - After generating the code, test it to ensure it works
   - You have up to 5 attempts to fix any issues
   - If the initial implementation fails, analyze the error and try again
   - Keep in mind that some websites have bot detection mechanisms

7. **Handle bot detection**:
   - If you encounter bot detection, CAPTCHA, or anti-scraping measures with `requests`
   - Consider switching to Playwright with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol)
   - Use the real user browser context to bypass detection
   - Maintain the same code quality standards regardless of approach

Before generating your code, use a scratchpad to plan your approach:

<scratchpad>
In your scratchpad:
- Summarize the key API endpoints found in the HAR file
- Note the authentication mechanism being used
- Identify any patterns or commonalities between requests
- Plan the structure of your Python script
- Consider potential issues (rate limiting, bot detection, etc.)
- Decide whether `requests` will be sufficient or if Playwright is needed
</scratchpad>

After your analysis, generate the files:

1. Save the Python script to: {self.scripts_dir}/api_client.py
2. Save the documentation to: {self.scripts_dir}/README.md

If your first attempt doesn't work, analyze what went wrong and try again. Document each attempt and what you learned.

<attempt_log>
For each attempt (up to 5), document:
- Attempt number
- What approach you tried
- What error or issue occurred (if any)
- What you changed for the next attempt
</attempt_log>

After testing, provide your final response with:
- A summary of the APIs discovered
- The authentication method used
- Whether the implementation works
- Any limitations or caveats
- The paths to the generated files

Your final output should confirm that the files have been created and provide a brief summary of what was accomplished.
Do not include the full code in your response - just confirm the files were saved and summarize the key findings.

## Tag-Based Workflows

This session uses tag-based context loading:

- **@id <run_id>**: Re-engineer mode active
  - Target run: {self.run_id}
  - HAR location: {self.har_path.parent}
  - Existing scripts: {self.scripts_dir}
  - Message history: {self.message_store.messages_path.parent} (available for reference if needed)
  - Fresh mode: {str(self.is_fresh).lower()}

By default, treat this as an iterative refinement. The user's prompt describes
changes or improvements to make to the existing script. If fresh mode is enabled,
ignore previous implementation and start from scratch.

Note: Full message history is available at the messages path above if you need
to understand previous context, but it is not automatically loaded into this
conversation.
